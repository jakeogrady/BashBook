#How to run the code:

\t - Firstly, download all necessary files and name them accordingly as seen in the server.sh script.

\t - Secondly, create in Documents a directory to contain all the output called 'BashBook'. This is done to prevent any of the files and folders created interfering with the rest of your files.

\t - To start the program, in one terminal run the command './server.sh' and then in another run the command './client.sh <name>' (name being whatever you like).

/t - Then in the client.sh terminal, enter a request and follow the instructions as provided by the program. If you want another user, open another terminal and run .client.sh <name> again with a different name.

It is advisable for new users to run 'create' as their first request in client.sh to create their account before anything else.
