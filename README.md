### How to run the code:

1. **Download all necessary files** and name them accordingly as seen in the `server.sh` script.
2. **Create a directory** in your Documents folder to contain all the output, called `BashBook`. This prevents any of the files and folders created from interfering with the rest of your files.
3. To start the program:
   - In one terminal, run the command:  
     ```bash
     ./server.sh
     ```
   - In another terminal, run the command:  
     ```bash
     ./client.sh <name>
     ```
     Replace `<name>` with whatever name you choose.
4. **In the `client.sh` terminal**, enter a request and follow the instructions provided by the program. If you want another user, open another terminal and run `client.sh` again with a different name.

It is advisable for new users to run the `create` command as their first request in `client.sh` to create their account before doing anything else.
